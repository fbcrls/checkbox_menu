# Checkbox in Flutter

 A checkbox in Flutter is a Material Design widget that allows users to select one or more options from a list. Checkbox widgets are typically used to collect user input, such as whether they agree to the terms and conditions of a service or whether they would like to receive marketing emails.

To create a checkbox in Flutter, you can use the Checkbox widget. The Checkbox widget takes a number of properties, including:

- value: The current value of the checkbox.
- onChanged: A callback function that is called when the value of the checkbox changes.
- tristate: A boolean value that indicates whether the checkbox can have three states (checked, unchecked, and null).
- activeColor: The color of the checkbox when it is checked.
- checkColor: The color of the checkmark when it is checked.
